\begin{frame}{The Contextual Importance of Statistics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Misinterpretation of statistical results is widespread.
    \item Journals have taken drastic actions (e.g., banning significance testing).
    \item Focus on educating and teaching concepts like P-values and confidence intervals, and the assumptions surrounding their models.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Common Misinterpretations of Single P-values} % 1-2
\begin{itemize}
    \item P-value is the probability that the hypothesis is true.
    \item The P-value is the probability that chance produced the observed association.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Misunderstanding Significance Results} % 3-5
\begin{itemize}
    \item Significant P-value means that the test(null) hypothesis is false.
    \item Nonsignificant P-value means that the test hypothesis is true.
    \item Large P-value is evidence in favor of the test hypothesis.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Signifiance and Null Hypotheses} % 6-8
\begin{itemize}
    \item A P-value greater than 0.05 means no effect was observed.
    \item Statistical significance indicates substantive importance.
    \item Lack of significance indicates a small effect size. 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Understanding Percentages in Context} % 9 - 11
\begin{itemize}
    \item The P-value is the chance of the data ocurring if the test hypothesis is true.
    \item If you reject the test hypothesis because \( P \leq 0.05 \), the chance you are in error is 5\%.
    \item \( P = 0.05 \) and \( P \leq 0.05 \) mean the same thing.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Final Misconceptions for P-values} % 12 - 14
\begin{itemize}
    \item P-values are properly reported as inequalities.
    \item Statistical significacnce is a property of the phenomenon being studied.
    \item One should always use two-sided P-values.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Controversial Interpretations of P-values}
\begin{itemize}
    \item P-values have been argued to overstate evidence against test hypotheses when compared to likelihood ratios or Bayes factors.
    \item Many statisticians dispute the use of these quantities as gold standards, asserting that P-values gauge error rates in decisions.
    \item From a frequentist view, \( 1 - P \) can measure evidence against the model used to compute the P-value.
    \item Controversies highlight differences in philosophical approaches to statistical interpretation.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Comparisons and Synthesis of Results} % 15 - 17
\begin{itemize}
    \item Lack of significant results across studies means no effect.
    \item Conflicting P-values across populations indicate disagreement.
    \item Identical P-values across populations indicate results are in agreement.
    \item A small P-value implies replacation will yield similar results.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Confidence Intervals} % 19 - 20, 22
\begin{itemize}
    \item A 95\% confidence interval has a 95\% chance of containing the true effect size.
    \item An effect size outside the 95\% confidence interval has been excluded by the data.
    \item A 95\% confidence interval predicts that 95\% of future studies will fall inside the interval.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Comparison of Confidence Intervals} % 21, 23
\begin{itemize}
    \item If two confidence intervals overlap, the differemce between two estimates is not significant.
    \item A 95\% confidence interval containing the null value(0) is more precise than one that doesn't
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Statistical Power} % 24, 25
\begin{itemize}
    \item If the power of your test is 90\%, the chance you are in error is 10\%.
    \item A nonsignificant result with high power supports the null hypothesis over alternatives.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{A Statistical Model Beyond Greek Letters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Underlying assumptions within the model
    \item Analysis and reporting bias, and their impacts
    \item Proposed solutions
    \item Contextual interpretation
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Conclusion: Reflecting on Statistical Testing}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Statistical tests were created to account for random variability as a source of error
    \item Founders of statistical testing emphasized tests as tools, not as final decisions.
    \item Some mininterpretations are harmless in tightly controlled experiments
    \item Shifting from hypothesis testing to estimation
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Key Takeaways and Final Statements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Focus on effect sizes, confidence limits, and precise P-values
    \item Critically examin known and hidden assumptions behind analysis and presentation
    \item Statistically nonsignificant results do not confirm the test hypothesis
    \item Use intervals to evaluate hypotheses, but recognize they represent best-case scenarios
    \item Analyze multiple studied carefully, addressing biases, and looking beyond statistical significance
    \item Avoid framing conlusions based just on hypothesis probabilities, and statistical tests
    \item Be thorough with the study's design, analysis choices, results presented
\end{itemize}
